I contributed as tutor for the gravitational-wave class of Prof. Bernuzzi during the summer semesters 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022. 
The summary page of the class can be found at [Bernuzzi's teaching page](http://sbernuzzi.gitpages.tpi.uni-jena.de/gw/index_SS2022.html). The arguments of the class were:
* Linearization around flat spacetime
* Energy, propagation, and interaction
* Generation of gravitational waves in linearized theory
* Gravitational-wave sources
* Compact binary inspirals
* The post-Newtonian expansion
* Linearization around black holes
* Effective-one-body description of the general-relativistic 2-body problem
* Strong, self-gravity and high-velocities source
* Gravitational-wave experiments and data analysis
