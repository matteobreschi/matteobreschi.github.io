I contributed as tutor for the gravitational-wave class during the summer semester 2021. 
The summary page of the class can be found at this [link](http://sbernuzzi.gitpages.tpi.uni-jena.de/gw/index_SS2021.html). The arguments of the class are:
* Linearization around flat spacetime
* Energy, propagation, and interaction
* Generation of GW in linearized theory
* GW sources
* The post-Newtonian expansion (Guest lecturer: Prof. G. Schäfer)
* Linearization around black holes
* Effective-one-body description of the general-relativistic 2-body problem (Guest lecturer: Prof. A. Nagar)
* Strong, self-gravity and high-velocities source
* GW experiments
* Data-analysis
