I contributed as tutor for the gravitational-wave class during the summer semester 2021. 
The summary page of the class can be found at this [link](http://sbernuzzi.gitpages.tpi.uni-jena.de/gw/index_SS2021.html). The arguments of the class are:
* Weak field limit of GR
* Waves on flat background
* GW energy
* Multipolar expansion
* The post-Newtonian expansion
* Linearization around black holes
* Effective-one-body description of the general-relativistic 2-body problem
* Strong, self-gravity and high-velocities source
* Detections and data-analysis
