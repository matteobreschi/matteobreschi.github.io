Astroparticle Physics, Cosmology and Gravitation are nowadays very active areas of research. The School aims at providing robust and detailed introductions on the basic theoretical concepts and tools needed for performing research in these fields. Gravitational waves of astrophysical and cosmological origin, neutrino physics and astronomy, dark matter and dark energy, galactic and extra-galactic cosmic rays and gamma-rays will be some among the main topics. The lecturers are selected among the best experts of our international communities.

It has been a pleasure for me to guide young students through the world of gravitational-wave physics together with Sebastiano Bernuzzi. During my tutorial sessions, we discussed the generation of gravitational signals from binary systems in close orbits, perturbed black holes, and signal processing methods. This adventure took place at the Galileo Galilei Institute in Arcetri (Florence), surrounded by beautiful hills and villas.
