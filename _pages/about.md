I am a theoretical physicist working on gravitational-wave physics and multi-messenger astronomy.
My research focuses on data analysis of astrophysical transients emitted by compact objects,
such as black holes and neutron stars.

I am member of the European Gravitational Observatory ([EGO](https://www.ego-gw.it/)),
thanks to which I contribute to the experiments of [Virgo](https://www.virgo-gw.eu/) and Einstein Telescope ([ET](https://www.et-gw.eu/)).
Moreover,
I am also part of the Computational Relativity collaboration ([CoRe](http://www.computational-relativity.org/)).

In these pages, you can find useful links and information on my research.
