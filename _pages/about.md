I am a gravitational physicist 
working on gravitational-wave physics and multi-messenger data analysis.

I am member of the European Gravitational Observatory ([EGO](https://www.ego-gw.it/)),
thanks to which I contribute to the experiments of [Virgo](https://www.virgo-gw.eu/) and Einstein Telescope ([ET](https://www.et-gw.eu/)).

I am also member of the Computational Relativity collaboration ([CoRe](http://www.computational-relativity.org/)),
where I contribute to the study and the analysis of numerical relativity simulations.

In these pages, you can find useful links and information on my research.
