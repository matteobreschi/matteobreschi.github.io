I am a theoretical physicist working on gravitational-wave physics and multi-messenger astronomy.
My research focuses on modeling and data analysis of astrophysical transients emitted by compact objects,
such as black holes and neutron stars.
I am also interested in the development of Bayesian inference techniques and in machine learning applications.

Currently, I am a postdoctoral fellow at the International School for Advanced Studies ([SISSA](https://www.sissa.it/))
in the Astroparticle physics ([APP](https://www.sissa.it/app/))
and the Theoretical and scientific data science ([TSDS](https://datascience.sissa.it/)) groups.
I am member of the European Gravitational Observatory ([EGO](https://www.ego-gw.it/)),
thanks to which I contribute to the experiments of [Virgo](https://www.virgo-gw.eu/)
and Einstein Telescope ([ET](https://www.et-gw.eu/)).
Moreover, I am also part of the Computational Relativity collaboration ([CoRe](http://www.computational-relativity.org/)).

In these pages, you can find useful links and information on my research.
