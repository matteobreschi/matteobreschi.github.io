Gravitational waves from binary neutron star (BNS) mergers can constrain nuclear matter models
predicting the neutron starâ€™s equation of state (EOS). Matter effects on the inspiral-merger signal
are encoded in the multipolar tidal polarizability parameters, whose leading order combination is
sufficient to capture to high accuracy the key features of the merger waveform (e.g. the merger
frequency). Similar EOS-insensitive relations exist for the post-merger signal and can be used to
model the emission from the remnant. Several works suggested that the appearance of new degrees
of freedom or phase transitions in high-density post-merger matter can be inferred by observing a
violation of these EOS-insensitive relations. Here, we demonstrate a Bayesian method to test such
an EOS-insensitive relation between the tidal polarizability parameters (or any other equivalent
parameter) and the dominant post-merger frequency, using information either up to merger or
from the post-merger signal. Technically, the method is similar to tests of General Relativity with
binary black holes that verify the inspiral-merger-ringdown consistency. However, differently from
the latter, BNS pre/post-merger consistency tests are conceptually less informative and they only
address the consistency (or the breaking) of the assumed EOS-insensitive relation. Specifically, we
discuss how such tests cannot conclusively discriminate between an EOS not respecting such relation
and the appearance of new degrees of freedom (or phase transitions) in high-density matter.
