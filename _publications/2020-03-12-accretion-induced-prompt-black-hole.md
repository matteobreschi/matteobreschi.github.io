We present new numerical relativity results of neutron star mergers with chirp mass 1.188M⊙ and mass ratios q=1.67 and q=1.8 using finite-temperature equations of state (EOS), approximate neutrino transport and a subgrid model for magnetohydrodynamics-induced turbulent viscosity. The EOS are compatible with nuclear and astrophysical constraints and include a new microphysical model derived from ab-initio calculations based on the Brueckner-Hartree-Fock approach. We report for the first time evidence for accretion-induced prompt collapse in high-mass-ratio mergers, in which the tidal disruption of the companion and its accretion onto the primary star determine prompt black hole formation. As a result of the tidal disruption, an accretion disc of neutron-rich and cold matter forms with baryon masses ∼0.15M⊙, and it is significantly heavier than the remnant discs in equal-masses prompt collapse mergers. Massive dynamical ejecta of order ∼0.01M⊙ also originate from the tidal disruption. They are neutron rich and expand from the orbital plane with a crescent-like geometry. Consequently, bright, red and temporally extended kilonova emission is predicted from these mergers. Our results show that prompt black hole mergers can power bright electromagnetic counterparts for high-mass-ratio binaries, and that the binary mass ratio can be in principle constrained from multimessenger observations.
