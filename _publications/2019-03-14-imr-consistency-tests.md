Current tests of General Relativity are performed using approximations which neglect a key feature of complete solution of Einstein's theory: higher-order modes. Our analysis will reassess these tests, including these higher-order mode effects. We have chosen to perform inspiral-merger-ringdown consistency tests on the gravitational transients detected by LIGO and Virgo during the observing run O2. We use an approximant which includes all higher modes with lâ‰¤4 (NRSur7dq2) and then, for the most interesting cases, we repeat the tests involving fits on Numerical Relativity simulations.
